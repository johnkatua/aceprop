          Being a Funded trader gives you the ability to 
          have a Funded Account with capital that you as a 
          retail trader wouldn’t be able to come up with or let’s 
          assume that you do have $100,000 laying around and want 
          to deposit to your broker, risking your own money or life-saving 
          in this case can be more complicated than using somebody’s 
          else money to trade and you get to keep 80% of 
          whatever you make after being funded.

          The majority of retail traders that do 
          not see success in trading after several 
          years of suffering on blowing accounts is 
          because of trading on small accounts with 
          expectations of doubling or tripping the 
          account which ends up blowing due 
          to aggressive trading style.

          Instead of trading on your small live account 
          of $500 and aim for a $10,000 return in a month 
          (which is an unrealistic goal of wanting a 2000% return in one month), 
          I recommend that you consider getting yourself 
          funded and aim for only a 10% return from a 
          $100,000 account. This way you will be 
          trading with less risk, pressure, and greed.
